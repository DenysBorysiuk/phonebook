## üóÇÔ∏è Project description 

This project is a Fullstack app that allows you to register a user and create a private collection of contacts.

Frontend built on React.
Backend is built on Node.js 
Database MongoDB

## Attention!!!

Backend deployed on Render.com as Free Web Services
Web Services on the free instance type are automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request.
This will cause a delay in the response of the first request after a period of inactivity while the instance spins up.
